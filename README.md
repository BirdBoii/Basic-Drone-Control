# Basic-Drone-Control
A MATLAB, parrot drone based drone control competition that I had made as part of some club activities. It is based on the parrot drone with certain parts removed for the participant to add in. The PDF contains all the nescissary information about how to go about the project and the base MATLAB project has also been included. Note that the addons may have to be downloaded to allow you to run the simulation.

Further some changes has been made to the control strucutre as well as some noise has been added to make PID tuning have more of an effect
